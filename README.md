# Rhythmic-Attunement-Theory
Rhythmic Attunement Theory (RAT): A physics framework based on the "phase closure" principle, offering a unified origin for mass and gravity. It derives fundamental constants and predicts a testable violation of the no-communication theorem, suggesting the possibility of superluminal communication.
